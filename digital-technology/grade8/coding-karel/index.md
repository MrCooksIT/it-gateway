# Introduction to Coding (JavaScript with Karel)
{: .text-blue-200 }

Learn programming fundamentals through Karel the Robot - your first step into the world of coding!

## Module Overview

This module introduces you to programming concepts using Karel, a virtual robot that lives in a grid world. By giving Karel commands and creating functions, you'll learn the fundamental building blocks of programming that apply to all programming languages.

## What You'll Learn

### ü§ñ Programming Basics
- **Commands and Syntax**: How to give precise instructions to computers
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex tasks into simple steps
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing errors in your programs

### üîß Functions and Organization
- **Custom Functions**: Creating your own commands for Karel
- **Code Organization**: Using the start() function and proper program structure
- **Top-Down Design**: Planning programs by breaking problems into smaller parts

### üîÑ Control Structures
- **For Loops**: Repeating actions a specific number of times
- **If Statements**: Making decisions based on conditions
- **If/Else Statements**: Handling different situations with alternative actions

### üìù Professional Practices
- **Code Comments**: Documenting your programs for others to understand
- **Function Naming**: Creating clear, descriptive names for your code
- **Program Style**: Writing clean, readable programs

## Learning Progression

### Foundations (Lessons 1-3)
- [Introduction to Programming With Karel](./intro-programming)

- [If Statements](./if-statements)
- [If/Else Statements](./if-else-statements)

### Advanced Topics (Term 2)
- While Loops in Karel
- Complex Problem Solving

## Key Programming Concepts

Through Karel programming, you'll master:

**Sequential Programming**: Commands execute in order, one after another

**Function Creation**: Building reusable blocks of code with custom names

**Repetition**: Using loops to repeat actions efficiently

**Decision Making**: Using conditions to make programs adapt to different situations

**Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable pieces

## Real-World Connections

The skills you learn with Karel directly transfer to:

- **Web Development**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Mobile App Development**: Swift, Java, Kotlin
- **Game Development**: C#, Python, JavaScript
- **Data Science**: Python, R, SQL
- **Robotics**: C++, Python, specialized robotics languages

## Assessment and Projects

Throughout this module, you'll demonstrate your learning through:

- **Programming Challenges**: Solve problems using Karel commands and functions
- **Code Reading Exercises**: Understand and trace through existing programs
- **Algorithm Design**: Plan solutions before coding
- **Code Documentation**: Write clear comments and explanations

## Why Karel?

Karel provides the perfect introduction to programming because:

- **Visual Feedback**: You can see exactly what your program does
- **Simple Commands**: Only four basic commands to learn initially
- **Gradual Complexity**: Start simple, build to sophisticated programs
- **Error-Friendly**: Mistakes are easy to spot and fix
- **Transferable Skills**: Concepts apply to all programming languages

## Getting Started

Begin with the **Introduction to Programming With Karel** lesson to learn the basics of giving commands to a computer. Each lesson builds on the previous one, so work through them in order.

By the end of this module, you'll be thinking like a programmer and ready to tackle more advanced programming concepts!
