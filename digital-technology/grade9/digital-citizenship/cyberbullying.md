## ⚡ What Makes Cyberbullying Especially Harmful

Cyberbullying has unique characteristics that make it particularly damaging:

### 🔄 Persistent
- **Digital devices allow constant communication**

## 🛡️ What to Do If You're Being Bullied

If you become a victim of cyberbullying, follow these important steps:

### ✅ DO:

#### 1. Document Everything 📋
- **Keep a record** of all messages, posts, and communications

### ❌ DON'T:

- **Do not respond** to threats or mean messages
- **This often encourages the bully** by giving them the reaction they want
- Responding can escalate the situation

#### 2. Don't Retaliate 🚫
- **Don't bully the bully back** - this brings you down to their level
- **You could get in trouble** for retaliatory behavior
- Two wrongs don't make a right

#### 3. Don't Spread the Harassment 🚫

- **Don't share screenshots** with friends for gossip
- You never know where the content might end up

#### 4. Don't Believe the Bully 🚫
- **Don't internalize the negative messages**
- The bullying says more about the bully than about you
- **Reach out for support** if the bullying affects your self-esteem
