## 📱 What is a Digital Footprint?

A **digital footprint** is the information about a particular person that exists on the Internet as a result of their online activity.

### Your Digital Footprint Includes:
- 📧 **Emails you send**
- 💬 **Comments you leave** on websites and social media
- 📸 **Pictures you post** or are tagged in
- 🔍 **Topics you search** for online
- 📱 **Apps you use** and data they collect
- 🌐 **Websites you visit** and interact with

{: .important-note }
**Remember**: Every time you use the Internet, you are building your digital footprint. It's crucial that your digital footprint tells a positive story about who you are!

## 🌐 Why the Internet is Public and Permanent

The Internet makes it very easy to share our thoughts and feelings with a wide audience, but there are two critical things to remember:

### The Internet is PUBLIC 🌍

When you post content online:
- **You lose control** over who sees it once it's posted
- **Privacy settings help** but don't guarantee privacy
- **Your posts can still be shared** through:
  - Screenshots
  - Sharing by friends
  - Forwarding and re-posting
- **Posts by other people** can impact your reputation (when they tag you or mention you)

{: .warning }
You may post something intended for close friends, but people you don't know well or even strangers might see that post and make assumptions about you.

### The Internet is PERMANENT 🔒

- **Deleting doesn't mean gone forever**
- **Deleted content can still exist in**:
  - Digital archives
  - Website servers
  - Screenshots taken by others
  - Cached versions of web pages

{: .key-concept }
**The Golden Rule**: Think before you post! Your posts are both permanent AND public.

## 👀 Who Looks at Your Digital Footprint?

Your online presence is often reviewed by people making important decisions about your future:

### 🎓 Educational Opportunities
- **College admissions officers** research applicants online
- **Scholarship committees** review candidates' digital presence
- **Academic programs** may check social media profiles

### 💼 Career Opportunities  
- **Potential employers** often search for job candidates online
- **HR departments** may review social media before hiring
- **Professional contacts** and networking connections

### 👥 Personal Relationships
- **Acquaintances** and new friends often look you up online
- **Dating prospects** frequently check social media profiles
- **Family members** and community members may see your content

{: .impact }
If your digital footprint makes people question your character, you could hurt your opportunities in college, career, and personal relationships.

## 📋 Social Media Guidelines

Follow these essential guidelines to protect your online reputation:

### ❌ DON'T:
- **Be a bully** - Cyberbullying is not okay and can have legal consequences
- **Post illegal activities** - Don't post or even hint at illegal behavior
- **Use inappropriate or hateful language** - Remember the Internet is public
- **Vent about school, teachers, or work** - This reflects poorly on your professionalism
- **Post anything you wouldn't want a teacher or future employer to see**

### ✅ DO:
- **Use common sense** - If it's not appropriate for a public and permanent space, don't post it
- **Think twice before posting** - Consider how it might be interpreted by different audiences
- **Be respectful** in all your online interactions
- **Share positive content** that reflects well on your character

## 🛡️ Maintaining Your Digital Footprint

Take active steps to manage and protect your online reputation:

### 1. Use Privacy Settings 🔐
- **Limit exposure** by adjusting privacy settings on all platforms
- **Review settings regularly** as platforms often change their policies
- **Understand** that privacy settings are not foolproof

### 2. Monitor Tags and Mentions 👁️
- **Review posts you're tagged in** by friends and acquaintances
- **Take action if needed** - untag yourself from questionable content
- **Ask friends to remove** inappropriate posts that include you

### 3. Clean Up Old Accounts 🧹
- **Permanently delete** old social media accounts you don't use
- **If you're not actively maintaining** a profile, others shouldn't have access to it
- **Update or remove** outdated information that no longer represents you

### 4. Google Yourself Regularly 🔍
- **Search your name** to see what comes up
- **Understand what kind of footprint** you're building
- **Make changes** if you discover concerning content
