## 🌍 Information is Everywhere

### The Information Challenge

The Internet gives us access to **massive amounts of information** - more than any generation in history has ever had access to.

**However**, it's very easy to find information that is:
- 🚫 **Misleading** or deliberately deceptive
- ❌ **Inaccurate** or factually wrong
- 📅 **Outdated** and no longer relevant
- 💰 **Biased** to promote certain viewpoints or products

{: .key-concept }
**This is why we need to be careful and develop strong information literacy skills to navigate the digital information landscape effectively.**

## 📚 What is Information Literacy?

**Information literacy** is having the ability to:

### 🔍 Find Information
- Conduct effective searches using appropriate keywords and techniques
- Navigate different types of information sources
- Use search engines and databases efficiently

### ⚖️ Evaluate Information Credibility
- Assess the reliability and accuracy of sources
- Identify bias and misinformation
- Distinguish between fact and opinion

### 💡 Use Information Effectively
- Apply information appropriately to solve problems
- Cite sources properly and avoid plagiarism

{: .important-note }
**Why it matters**: Information literacy ensures you're finding and using reliable sources online, making informed decisions, and avoiding the spread of misinformation.

## 🔍 Effective Internet Search Techniques

Knowing how to search effectively can save you time and help you find more relevant, accurate information.

### 🎯 Use Specific Keywords

**Be specific** when defining your search topic.

#### Example Question: "Which US state produces the most solar energy?"

| ❌ Too General | ✅ Effective Keywords |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "solar power" | "United States solar energy production" |
| "energy" | "US state solar energy statistics" |

**Why specificity matters**: Vague searches return too many irrelevant results, making it harder to find what you actually need.

### 📝 Search for Exact Phrases

**Use quotation marks** to search for exact phrases.

#### Examples:
- `"solar energy"` - Returns results containing the exact phrase "solar energy"
- `"climate change effects"` - Finds pages with that exact phrase together
- `"renewable energy statistics"` - Searches for those words in that exact order

{: .search-tip }
**Benefit**: Quotation marks help narrow results to pages that discuss your exact topic rather than pages that just happen to contain those words separately.

### ➕➖ Use + and - to Narrow Searches

**Plus (+) means AND** - include this term
**Minus (-) means NOT** - exclude this term

#### Examples:
- `"solar energy" +USA` - Results must contain "solar energy" AND "USA"
- `"solar energy" -jobs` - Results contain "solar energy" but NOT "jobs"
- `climate +statistics -opinion` - Include statistics, exclude opinion pieces

#### Important Format Rules:
- **No space** between +/- and the keyword: `-jobs` ✅ not `- jobs` ❌
- Works with both individual words and quoted phrases

{: .advanced-tip }
**Use case**: This is especially helpful when researching broad topics that have multiple aspects, and you want to focus on just one area.

## 🚨 Recognizing Advertising

### 💰 Sponsored Links and Ads

**Sponsored links** are forms of advertisements where companies **pay to appear at the top** of search results.

#### Warning Signs:
- 📍 **"Ad" or "Sponsored" labels** near search results
- 🔝 **Top placement** that seems too convenient
- 💼 **Commercial focus** rather than informational content
- 🎯 **Perfect match** to commercial keywords

### ⚠️ Why Ads Aren't Credible Sources

**Ads are NOT credible sources** because:
- Companies **pay for placement**, not accuracy
- Content is designed to **sell products**, not inform
- Information may be **biased** toward the company's interests
- **No peer review** or fact-checking requirements

{: .warning }
**Remember**: Just because something appears at the top of search results doesn't mean it's the most accurate or reliable information.

## ⚖️ Judging Source Legitimacy

When evaluating whether a source is legitimate, examine these key factors:

### 👤 Author Credentials

#### Questions to Ask:
- **Is there an author listed?** (Anonymous sources are often unreliable)
- **What are their credentials?** (Education, experience, expertise)
- **Are they an expert** in the topic they're writing about?
- **Can you find information** about the author elsewhere?

#### Red Flags:
- No author listed anywhere on the site
- Author has no relevant qualifications
- Author's credentials can't be verified

### 📅 Publication Date

#### Why Date Matters:
- **Recent information** is often more accurate and relevant
- **Outdated information** may no longer be true
- **Time-sensitive topics** (technology, science, current events) need recent sources

#### Guidelines:
- **Within 2-3 years** is generally good for most topics
- **More recent** for rapidly changing fields (technology, medicine)
- **Historical topics** may use older primary sources appropriately

### 📚 Source Citations

#### What to Look For:
- **Are scholarly sources cited?** (Academic papers, official reports)
- **Are sources listed** and easily verifiable?
- **Do citations support** the claims being made?
- **Are sources diverse** rather than all from one perspective?

#### Warning Signs:
- No sources cited at all
- Sources are other unreliable websites
- Citations don't actually support the claims

### 🌐 Website Domain

#### Generally Reliable Domains:
- **.edu** - Educational institutions (universities, schools)
- **.gov** - Government organizations and agencies
- **.org** - Often non-profit organizations (but verify)

#### Requires More Caution:
- **.com** - Commercial sites (anyone can purchase)
- **.net** - Network sites (anyone can purchase)
- **.info** - Information sites (anyone can purchase)

{: .evaluation-tip }
**Note**: Domain alone doesn't determine credibility, but .edu and .gov sites generally have higher standards for accuracy.

### 🎨 Site Design and Quality

#### Professional Indicators:
- **Clear navigation** and organization
- **Consistent design** throughout the site
- **Working links** and functional features
- **Contact information** readily available

#### Warning Signs:
- Confusing or cluttered layout
- Broken links or missing images
- Unprofessional appearance
- No contact information

### ✍️ Writing Quality

#### Credible Sources Should Have:
- **Proper spelling** and grammar
- **Clear, professional writing** style
- **Logical organization** of information
- **Objective tone** (for informational content)

#### Red Flags:
- Frequent spelling and grammar errors
- Emotional or sensational language
- Poor organization or unclear writing
- Obvious bias in language choices

## 🚫 Identifying Misinformation

Misinformation can be subtle and convincing. Here's how to spot it:

### 🎭 Author Bias and Agenda

#### Questions to Consider:
- **Is the author pushing** a certain viewpoint or agenda?
- **Who benefits** if people believe this information?
- **Are emotional appeals** being used instead of facts?
- **Is only one side** of a complex issue presented?

#### Investigation Steps:
- **Search for the author's name** to learn about their background
- **Look for conflicts of interest** (financial, political, personal)
- **Check if the author** has expertise in the subject area

### 📖 Source Quality Check

#### Evaluate Cited Sources:
- **Do cited sources look credible?** Apply the same evaluation criteria
- **Are sources scholarly** and peer-reviewed when appropriate?
- **Can you access** the original sources to verify claims?
- **Do sources actually support** the conclusions drawn?

### 🔍 Cross-Reference Information

#### Verification Strategy:
- **Search for the same information** on multiple credible sites
- **Check fact-checking websites** (Snopes, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact)
- **Look for consensus** among reliable sources
- **Be suspicious** if only one source reports "exclusive" information

{: .fact-check }
**Rule of thumb**: If you can't find the information on other credible sites, it's probably not true or needs more verification.
