## 🌐 Staying Safe Online

The Internet has become a fantastic place to socialize, learn, and explore, but it's important to be aware of the risks involved in online activities.

### Why Internet Safety Matters
- 👥 **Social interaction** happens increasingly online

- 🛡️ **Prevention is easier** than dealing with problems after they occur

{: .key-concept }

## 📋 Essential Safety Guidelines

Follow these fundamental guidelines to stay safe while enjoying online activities:

### 🚨 Be Wary of Strangers
**Always proceed with caution when communicating with people you don't know in real life.**

#### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Someone claiming to know you but you don't recognize them
- People asking lots of personal questions early in conversations
- Individuals who seem too interested in meeting in person quickly
- Anyone who asks you to keep your conversations secret

#### Verification Steps:
- **Ask friends** if they know this person in real life
- **Check if friends** are being contacted by the same person
- **Remember**: It's very easy for people to be dishonest about their identity online
- **Trust your instincts** - it's good to be wary of unknown people

{: .warning }
**Important**: Being cautious online doesn't mean being unfriendly - it means being smart about protecting yourself.

## 🔒 Protecting Personal Information

Your personal information is valuable and can be used by malicious people to harm you. Be extremely careful about what you share.

### ❌ Don't Include in Usernames:
- **Full name** or real name
- **Birthday** or age information
- **Location** details (city, school, etc.)
- **Phone numbers** or addresses

### 🚫 Avoid Sharing These "Small" Details:
Even information that seems unimportant can be dangerous:
- **School mascot** or school name
- **Daily schedule** or routine information
- **Family details** or home situation
- **Photos** that show location markers or school uniforms
- **Check-ins** at specific locations

### 🔍 Why "Small" Details Matter:
Predatory people can use seemingly harmless information to:
- **Piece together** your identity and location
- **Find you** in real life
- **Build trust** by pretending to know things about you
- **Target you** more effectively

{: .danger }
**Stop communication immediately** if someone keeps asking for personal information - this could be a predatory person trying to jeopardize your safety.

## 🛡️ When to Block and Report

Don't hesitate to use protective tools when you feel uncomfortable or threatened.

### 🚫 Block Communication When:
- Someone makes you feel **uncomfortable or unsafe**
- A person **ignores your boundaries** or requests to stop
- Someone **asks inappropriate questions** or makes inappropriate comments
- You feel **pressured** to share information or meet in person
- **Your instincts tell you** something isn't right

### 📢 Report to Website Administrators When:
- Someone **continues to contact you** after being blocked
- A person **harasses or threatens you**
- Someone **asks for inappropriate photos** or information
- You encounter **clearly predatory behavior**
- Anyone tries to **arrange meetings** or asks for your location

### 💪 Remember:
- **You have the right** to feel safe online
- **Blocking and reporting** are tools designed to protect you
- **It's not rude** to protect yourself from uncomfortable situations
- **Website administrators** take safety reports seriously

## 🤝 Ask for Help

Never hesitate to seek guidance from trusted adults when dealing with online situations.

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Talk to Trusted Adults When:
- You're **unsure about an online interaction** or relationship
- Someone **makes you feel uncomfortable** but you're not sure how to respond
- You've **blocked someone** but they continue to find ways to contact you
- You **accidentally shared** personal information and are worried
- You **need advice** about how to handle a specific online situation

### 🎯 Trusted Adults Include:
- **Parents or guardians** who understand your online activities
- **Teachers or school counselors** who can provide guidance
- **Coaches or mentors** who know you well
- **Family members** you trust and feel comfortable talking to

### 💬 How to Ask for Help:
- **Be honest** about what happened online
- **Share any evidence** (screenshots) if appropriate
- **Don't worry** about getting in trouble for asking questions
- **Explain your concerns** clearly so adults can help effectively

{: .support }
**Remember**: Trusted adults want to help keep you safe - they're not there to judge you or get you in trouble for asking questions.

## 🧠 Use Common Sense and Trust Your Instincts

Your intuition is a powerful safety tool in online environments.

### 🚨 Trust Your Instincts When:
- **Something feels "off"** about a person or situation
- **Someone seems too interested** in personal details
- **Conversations move too quickly** toward personal topics
- **Someone pressures you** to do anything you're not comfortable with
- **A situation doesn't feel right** for any reason

### 🤔 Ask Yourself:
- Would I be comfortable with this person/situation in real life?
- Am I being pressured to share information I normally wouldn't?
- Does this person's story seem consistent and believable?
- Would I want my parents/teachers to know about this conversation?

{: .wisdom }
**Golden Rule**: If a situation doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Don't be afraid to take protective steps or ask for help.
