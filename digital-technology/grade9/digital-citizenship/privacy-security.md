## 🔐 Data Privacy vs. Data Security

Understanding the difference between privacy and security is essential for protecting yourself online.

### 🛡️ Data Security
**The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data**

Data security includes all practices and processes that ensure:
- **Data isn't accessed** by unauthorized individuals
- **Data remains accurate** and reliable
- **Data is available** when authorized users need it
- **Unauthorized parties** cannot use or modify data

### 🔒 Data Privacy  
**The appropriate use of your data**

Data privacy means:
- **Data is used** according to agreed purposes
- **Companies use information** as intended when you provided it
- **Your consent** is respected regarding how data is used
- **Appropriate boundaries** exist around data sharing

{: .important-note }
**Remember**: Companies need data security policies to ensure data privacy. Security is the means; privacy is the goal.

## 💪 Strong Password Practices

Your first line of defense against unauthorized access is creating strong, unique passwords.

### 🔑 Password Requirements

#### Strong passwords should contain:
- **8-20 characters** in length (longer is better)
- **Capital and lowercase letters** (mixed case)
- **Special characters** (! @ # $ % ^ & *)
- **Numbers** throughout the password
- **Different passwords** for different accounts

#### Password Strength Examples:

| ❌ Weak | ✅ Strong |
|---------|-----------|
| password123 | *pA$s5%w0Rxd86#18 |
| codehs2018 | c0#d*3HhSs!()fn |

### 🎯 Password Creation Tips:

#### ✅ DO:
- **Make passwords completely random** - avoid full words
- **Use complex combinations** of characters
- **Create unique passwords** for each account
- **Consider using phrases** converted to complex passwords

#### ❌ DON'T:
- **Include personal details** (birthday, graduation year, name)
- **Spell out full words** (the more random, the better)
- **Store passwords** in Notes, Evernote, iMessage, or other apps
- **Reuse passwords** across multiple accounts

{: .security-tip }
**Why unique passwords matter**: If one password is hacked, only one account is compromised instead of all your accounts.

---

## 🛠️ Advanced Security Tools

### 🔐 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
**A two-step verification process for added security**

Common 2FA methods include:
- **Text messages** with unique PINs to your phone
- **Phone calls** with spoken verification codes
- **Security questions** specific to you (first pet, childhood street)
- **Authenticator apps** that generate time-based codes

{: .enhancement }
**Benefit**: Even if someone steals your password, they still can't access your account without the second factor.

### 🗃️ Password Managers
**Tools that help manage and diversify your passwords**

Password managers can:
- **Generate complex, random passwords** for each account
- **Store and organize** all your passwords securely
- **Auto-fill login forms** on websites and apps
- **Sync across devices** for convenient access

#### ⚠️ Important Considerations:
- **Keep your master password safe** - write it down and store it securely
- **Store master password on paper** in a safe or secure location
- **Choose reputable password managers** with strong security records

---

## 🌐 Secure Website Browsing

### 🔒 Identifying Secure Sites

#### Look for HTTPS:
- **https://** = Secure connection with encryption
- **http://** = Less secure, unencrypted connection
- **The "s" stands for "secure"** and uses complex encryption

#### Additional Security Checks:
- **Verify the URL** matches what you expected to visit
- **Watch for redirects** to unexpected or suspicious sites
- **Check for the padlock icon** in your browser's address bar

### 🚨 Safe Browsing Practices

#### Red Flags to Avoid:
- **Excessive pop-ups** (1-2 might be okay, more is suspicious)
- **Unfamiliar URLs** or unexpected redirects
- **Requests for immediate downloads** of unknown software
- **Sites asking for unnecessary personal information**

#### Security Protocol:
1. **Always verify URLs** before entering sensitive information
2. **Use your best judgment** - if a site seems sketchy, leave
3. **Trust your instincts** about website legitimacy
4. **Check the padlock icon** for connection security details

---

## 🔧 Hardware Security Settings

Modern security extends beyond websites to your actual devices and their capabilities.

### 🎥 Hardware Access Permissions

Apps and websites may request access to:
- **Webcam** - for video calls or photos
- **Microphone** - for voice recording or calls
- **Location** - for maps or location-based services
- **Files** - for uploading or file management

### 🔍 Checking Your Permissions

To review what access you've granted:
1. **Click the padlock icon** next to the URL in your browser
2. **View connection details** and site settings
3. **Review permissions** for camera, microphone, location
4. **Revoke access** if you no longer want to grant it

{: .privacy-tip }
**Regular check-up**: Review your permissions periodically because it's easy to accidentally grant access and forget to turn it off.

## 📋 Understanding Privacy Policies

### 📜 What Are Privacy Policies?

Privacy policies are **legal documents** that disclose:
- **How websites gather** your data
- **How they store** your information
- **How they share** your data with others
- **What rights you have** regarding your data

### 🤔 Why They Matter

By checking "I agree," you might be granting permission to:
- **Sell your information** to third parties
- **Read your emails** or messages
- **Access your photos** or files
- **Track your browsing** across websites
- **Target advertisements** based on your activity

### 📖 Reading Privacy Policies

#### ⚠️ The Reality:
- **Most policies are lengthy** and deliberately difficult to read
- **Users often skip them** entirely
- **Important details** are often buried in complex language

#### 💡 Practical Approach:
- **Scan for key sections** about data sharing and usage
- **Look for plain-language summaries** when available
- **Research major companies** - online summaries often exist
- **Ask yourself**: Am I comfortable with how they'll use my data?

### 🎯 Understanding Targeted Advertising

Ever wonder why that watch you Googled appears in your Instagram feed? **That's your data being used for targeted advertising.**

Companies use your data to:
- **Track your interests** and browsing habits
- **Create advertising profiles** about you
- **Target specific products** based on your activity
- **Generate revenue** from your personal information

## 🎣 Avoiding Phishing Scams

### 🐟 What is Phishing?

**Phishing** is a method to gather personal information (usernames, passwords, credit card numbers) using deceptive emails and websites.

### 🚨 Common Phishing Tactics:

#### Email Red Flags:
- **Familiar-looking addresses** with subtle misspellings
- **Urgent requests** for immediate action
- **Links to fake login portals** that steal your credentials
- **Requests for sensitive information** via email

#### Website Red Flags:
- **URLs that look similar** but aren't quite right
- **Login pages** that don't match the official design
- **Requests for unnecessary information** during login

### 🔍 How to Spot Phishing:

1. **Check email addresses carefully** for misspellings
2. **Hover over links** before clicking to see the real destination
3. **Go directly to websites** instead of clicking email links
4. **Be suspicious** of urgent requests for personal information
5. **Verify requests** through official company channels
