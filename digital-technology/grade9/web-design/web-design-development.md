- 🏢 **Brand Integration**: Ensuring the design matches the company's brand identity
- 📖 **Readability**: Making information easy to read and consume

#### Design Process:
1. **Understanding the brief** and client requirements
2. **Researching** user needs and competitor sites
3. **Creating wireframes** and site structure
4. **Designing mockups** that visually represent the final site
5. **Testing and refining** the design based on feedback
