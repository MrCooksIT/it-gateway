## üíª Fundamental Computer Concepts

### The Information Processing Cycle

Understanding how computers process data is fundamental to IT:

```
Input ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Output
```

{: .highlight }
**Real-World Example**: 
1. **Input**: You type a document (keyboard)
2. **Processing**: Computer formats text (CPU)
3. **Storage**: Save to hard drive (HDD/SSD)
4. **Output**: Print the document (printer)

### Hardware Components

#### Input Devices
Convert human actions into digital signals:

| Device | Function | Example Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Keyboard** | Text and command input | Typing documents |
| **Mouse** | Pointing and selecting | Clicking icons |
| **Microphone** | Audio input | Voice recording |
| **Scanner** | Convert physical to digital | Digitizing photos |
| **Camera** | Capture images/video | Video calls |

#### Output Devices
Present processed information to users:

| Device | Function | Example Use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Monitor** | Visual display | Viewing content |
| **Printer** | Physical output | Hard copies |
| **Speakers** | Audio output | Music, alerts |
| **Projector** | Large display | Presentations |

#### Processing Components

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- The "brain" of the computer
- Executes all instructions
- Speed measured in GHz (gigahertz)

**RAM (Random Access Memory)**
- Temporary storage for active programs
- Volatile (loses data when power off)
- More RAM = better multitasking

### Memory vs Storage

{: .important }
**Key Distinction**: Memory (RAM) is temporary; Storage (HDD/SSD) is permanent

| Feature | RAM | Storage (HDD/SSD) |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| **Speed** | Very fast | Slower than RAM |
| **Volatility** | Loses data when off | Keeps data permanently |
| **Purpose** | Running programs | Saving files |
| **Cost** | More expensive/GB | Less expensive/GB |

### Storage Technologies

**HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**
- Magnetic storage technology
- Moving parts (spinning disks)
- Cheaper per GB
- Slower access times
- More fragile

**SSD (Solid State Drive)**
- Flash memory technology
- No moving parts
- More expensive per GB
- Much faster access
- More durable

### Connectivity and Ports

Understanding how devices connect:

| Port Type | Purpose | Example Devices |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **USB** | Universal connection | Mouse, keyboard, flash drives |
| **HDMI** | High-definition video/audio | Monitors, TVs |
| **Ethernet** | Network connection | Internet cable |
| **Audio jack** | Sound input/output | Headphones, microphones |

## üñ•Ô∏è Software and Systems

### Software Categories

**System Software**
- Manages computer hardware
- Provides platform for applications
- Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux

**Application Software**
- Programs for specific tasks
- Run on top of system software
- Examples: Word, Chrome, Games

{: .note }
**Remember**: System software manages the computer; Application software helps users complete tasks

### Operating System Functions

The OS is like a manager that:

1. **Manages Files**: Organizes and stores your documents
2. **Controls Memory**: Decides which programs get RAM
3. **Handles Devices**: Makes printer, mouse, etc. work
4. **Provides Interface**: What you see and click on

### Software Licensing Models

| Model | Description | Cost | Example |
|-------|-------------|------|---------|
| **Proprietary** | Owned by company, closed source | Purchase required | Microsoft Office |
| **Freeware** | Free to use forever | Free | VLC Media Player |
| **Shareware** | Free trial, then pay | Free trial, then pay | WinRAR |
| **Open Source** | Source code available | Usually free | LibreOffice |

### System Design Principles

**Modular Design Benefits**:
- Components can be replaced individually
- Easier troubleshooting
- Cost-effective upgrades
- Standardized parts

Example: You can upgrade just your graphics card without replacing the entire computer!

## üåê Networking Fundamentals

### What is a Network?

A network is two or more computers connected to share resources and communicate.

**Why Use Networks?**

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Share resources (printers, files) | Security risks |
| Centralized data backup | Setup complexity |
| Communication between users | Maintenance costs |
| Internet connection sharing | Network dependency |

### Network Components

**Essential Hardware**:

1. **Switch**: 
   - Connects multiple devices in a network
   - Directs data to specific devices
   - Like a smart traffic controller

2. **Node**: 
   - Any device on the network
   - Examples: computers, printers, phones

3. **NIC (Network Interface Card)**:
   - Hardware that enables network connection
   - Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi)

4. **Cables/Wireless**:
   - Physical connections (CAT5/6 cables)
   - Radio waves (Wi-Fi)

### Network Types by Size

| Type | Coverage | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **PAN** | Personal (few meters) | Bluetooth headphones |
| **LAN** | Local Area (building) | School network |
| **MAN** | Metropolitan (city) | City-wide Wi-Fi |
| **WAN** | Wide Area (countries) | The Internet |

## üî¢ Data Management and Number Systems

### Number System Conversions

#### Binary (Base 2)
Uses only 0 and 1:

**Binary to Decimal**:
```
11001010‚ÇÇ = 1√ó2‚Å∑ + 1√ó2‚Å∂ + 0√ó2‚Åµ + 0√ó2‚Å¥ + 1√ó2¬≥ + 0√ó2¬≤ + 1√ó2¬π + 0√ó2‚Å∞
         = 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
         = 202‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ
```

#### Hexadecimal (Base 16)
Uses 0-9 and A-F (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15):

**Hexadecimal to Decimal**:
```
2CD‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ = 2√ó16¬≤ + C√ó16¬π + D√ó16‚Å∞
      = 2√ó256 + 12√ó16 + 13√ó1
      = 512 + 192 + 13
      = 717‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ
```

**Decimal to Hexadecimal**:
```
417‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ √∑ 16 = 26 remainder 1
26 √∑ 16 = 1 remainder 10 (A)
1 √∑ 16 = 0 remainder 1
Read bottom to top: 1A1‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ
```

### Data Representation Fundamentals

**Bit vs Byte**:
- **Bit**: Single binary digit (0 or 1)
- **Byte**: 8 bits grouped together
- **Why important**: All computer data is stored as bits!

### Data Types and Their Uses

| Data Type | Description | Example | Storage |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Integer** | Whole numbers | Age: 16 | 2-4 bytes |
| **Real/Float** | Decimal numbers | Price: 19.99 | 4-8 bytes |
| **String** | Text | Name: "John" | 1 byte per character |
| **Boolean** | True/False | isStudent: True | 1 bit (stored as byte) |

### File Management Essentials

**File Extensions Tell You**:
- What type of file it is
- Which program opens it
- How the data is stored

Common Extensions:
- `.txt` - Plain text
- `.docx` - Word document
- `.jpg` - Image file
- `.mp3` - Audio file
- `.exe` - Program file

## üí° Programming Fundamentals

### What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.

{: .highlight }
**Think of it like a recipe**: Clear instructions that anyone can follow to get the same result

### Algorithm Representation

**1. Flowcharts** (Visual):
```
[Start] ‚Üí [Input Numbers] ‚Üí <Is A > B?> ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí [Output A]
                                ‚Üì No
                            [Output B] ‚Üí [End]
```

**2. Pseudocode** (Written):
```
BEGIN
  INPUT number1, number2
  IF number1 > number2 THEN
    OUTPUT number1
  ELSE
    OUTPUT number2
  END IF
END
```

### Understanding Variables

Variables are containers that store data:

```pascal
var
  age: integer;      // Stores whole numbers
  price: real;       // Stores decimals  
  name: string;      // Stores text
  isReady: boolean;  // Stores true/false
```

### Variable Operations

**Mathematical Operations**:
- Addition: `total := price + tax`
- Subtraction: `change := paid - cost`
- Multiplication: `area := length * width`
- Division: `average := total / count`

**Order of Operations** (BODMAS):
1. Brackets
2. Orders (powers)
3. Division and Multiplication (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

## üõ°Ô∏è Digital Citizenship and Ethics

### Software Piracy

**What is it?** Unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted software

**Why Avoid It?**
- **Legal**: Heavy fines and criminal charges
- **Security**: Pirated software often contains malware
- **Ethical**: Developers deserve payment for their work
- **Updates**: No access to security updates

### The Digital Divide

The gap between those with and without access to digital technology.

**Contributing Factors**:

| Factor | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Economic** | Cost of devices/internet | Can't afford computer |
| **Geographic** | Infrastructure availability | No internet in rural areas |
| **Educational** | Digital literacy skills | Don't know how to use technology |
| **Age** | Generational differences | Elderly unfamiliar with tech |

**Impact on Organizations**:
- Limited reach for digital services
- Excludes potential customers/users
- May need alternative service methods
