## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware & System Technologies

### Motherboard Architecture

The motherboard is the central communication hub of a computer:

{: .highlight }
**Key Components:**

- **CPU Socket**: Houses the processor
- **RAM Slots**: Hold memory modules
- **Expansion Slots**: PCIe for graphics cards, etc.
- **BIOS/UEFI Chip**: Basic Input/Output System
- **Chipset**: Controls data flow between components

### Memory Hierarchy

Understanding different types of memory:

| Type                  | Speed   | Volatility   | Purpose                      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Cache**             | Fastest | Volatile     | CPU's quick access memory    |
| **RAM**               | Fast    | Volatile     | Active program storage       |
| **Virtual Memory**    | Slow    | Non-volatile | Hard drive space used as RAM |
| **Storage (SSD/HDD)** | Slowest | Non-volatile | Permanent data storage       |

{: .note }
**Virtual Memory**: When RAM is full, the OS uses hard drive space as temporary RAM. This is slower but prevents crashes!

### System Performance Factors

**What affects computer speed:**

1. **CPU Speed** (GHz) - How fast instructions are processed
2. **RAM Capacity** - How much can be stored for quick access
3. **Storage Type** - SSD is much faster than HDD
4. **GPU** - Handles graphics processing separately

### Operating System Functions

**Primary Roles:**

## üíª Programming Concepts

### Loop Structures

**Definite vs Indefinite Loops:**

```pascal
// Definite Loop - Known iterations
for i := 1 to 10 do
  ShowMessage(IntToStr(i));

// Indefinite Loop - Unknown iterations
while not EOF(textFile) do
  ReadLn(textFile, line);

// Post-test Loop - Runs at least once
repeat
  password := InputBox('Login', 'Enter password:', '');
until password = 'correct';
```

{: .important }
**Key Difference**: `while` tests condition first, `repeat` tests after execution

### Variable Scope

**Global vs Local Variables:**

- **Global**: Accessible throughout entire program
- **Local**: Only within specific procedure/function

**Best Practice**: Use local variables when possible to avoid conflicts

### Algorithm Representation

**Methods to Express Algorithms:**

1. **Pseudocode**: Plain language steps
2. **Flowcharts**: Visual diagram with shapes
3. **Code**: Actual programming language

### File Handling Concepts

**Text File Operations:**

- **Human Readable**: Can be opened in Notepad
- **Sequential Access**: Read from start to end

**File Commands Summary:**

- `AssignFile`: Connect variable to file
- `Reset`: Open existing file for reading
- `Rewrite`: Create new file (overwrites!)
- `Append`: Open existing file to add data
- `CloseFile`: Save and release file

### Information Hierarchy

```
Data ‚Üí Information ‚Üí Knowledge ‚Üí Wisdom
```

- **Data**: Raw facts (42, "John", 15.5)
