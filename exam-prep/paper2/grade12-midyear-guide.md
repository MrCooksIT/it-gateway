**Database Relationships:**

- **Many-to-Many**: Multiple records in each table relate to multiple records in another
- **Junction Tables**: Bridge tables that handle many-to-many relationships
- **Example**: Employees working on multiple projects, projects having multiple employees

**Normalization Benefits:**

- Reduces data redundancy and inconsistency
- Improves data integrity and maintenance
- Prevents data anomalies during updates

### **Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals**

**Class Definition**: Blueprint or template for creating objects
**Key Components:**

- **Attributes**: Data stored in objects (properties)
- **Methods**: Functions that objects can perform (behaviors)

**Visibility Modifiers:**

- **Private (-)**: Only accessible within the class
- **Public (+)**: Accessible from outside the class
- **Purpose**: Encapsulation and data protection

**Essential Methods:**

- **Constructor**: Initializes new objects with starting values
- **Getter Methods**: Return private attribute values
- **Setter Methods**: Modify private attribute values safely

**Method Parameters**: Values passed to methods for processing
**Example**: `setBatteryHealth(newHealth: real)` receives a parameter

- **While-Do**: Tests condition first, may not execute
- **For**: Definite loops with predetermined iterations

**Conditional Structures:**

- **Nested IF-ELSE**: Multiple condition checking
- **CASE Statements**: Multiple option selection (cleaner than nested IFs)

### **Algorithm Design**

**Password Validation Algorithm Example:**

```
Function IsStrongPassword(password: string): Boolean
- Check length >= 8 characters
- Verify uppercase letter present
- Verify lowercase letter present
- Verify digit present
- Return true if all conditions met
```

**Algorithm Improvement Strategies:**

- Input validation and error handling
- Clear variable naming and documentation
- Modular design with functions/procedures
