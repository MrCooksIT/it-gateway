### ‚úÖ True/False Questions
- **Look for**: Absolute terms (always, never, all, none)
- **Consider**: Exceptions to general rules
- **Remember**: One wrong part makes the whole statement false

### üîó Matching Questions
- **Strategy**: Do the easy ones first
- **Use**: Process of elimination for difficult matches
- **Check**: That each answer is used only once

### üìä Comparison Tables
**Know advantages AND disadvantages of:**
- Different storage types (HDD vs SSD)
- Network models (client-server vs peer-to-peer)
- Software types (proprietary vs open-source)
- Communication methods (synchronous vs asynchronous)

### üìù Scenario Questions
**Approach:**
1. **Read carefully** - Identify the problem or situation
2. **Apply concepts** - Use relevant IT knowledge
3. **Justify choices** - Explain why your solution is appropriate
4. **Consider constraints** - Budget, time, user needs, etc.

## Study Strategies by Grade

## Mark Allocation Patterns

### Time Management Strategy

| Question Type | Marks | Time Allocation |
|---------------|-------|----------------|
| **Short Questions** | 15-20 | 15-20 minutes |
| **Major Sections** | 20-30 each | 25-30 minutes each |
| **Scenario Questions** | 25-30 | 30-35 minutes |
| **Review Time** | - | 10-15 minutes |

### Answer Length Guidelines

**1 mark = 1 key point or fact**
**2 marks = 2 points OR 1 point with explanation**
**3+ marks = Multiple points with examples/justification**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Give examples without explaining the concept
- Write everything you know without answering the specific question
- Forget to read mark allocations (they guide answer length)
- Skip difficult questions completely (attempt partial answers)

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Answer exactly what's asked
- Use technical terminology correctly
- Provide specific examples when requested
- Structure longer answers with clear points
